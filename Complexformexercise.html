<!-- Okay, the steps here: 
1. Overall form
2. Register Heading
3. First and last name text box
	-Use 'for' and 'id' to do the labelling, and make sure you're giving each a name to assign the value to (don't assign a value, it'll be the name they give)
	-You'll want to make sure they're required & have a placeholder tex
4. Male/Female Radio
	-connect the radio tags with a name so it's an either or, assign value to both so the computer knows what value to send depending on which is selected
5. Email & password 
 	-easy enough, just make sure it's required
6. Birthday dropdown menu
	-You'll be using 3 separate menus with select|option (like ul|li)
	-To group them together on one line maybe you put them in a paragrapH? I think you'll put a 'p' around each group. Or maybe a list? Let's try list first. Well no, that'll give bullet points. Okay, just try nothing then group with p if necessary
	Nope! It was divs. When you tried spans it all went in one line. YOu did one big div below register, and then div'd each line
7. Terms and conditions menu
	-Simple checkbox input
8. Submit button
	-2 ways, but you can just do simple button tag-->

<!-- You had to get fancy here with the pattern attribute and a regular expression (regex), and then use
this setcustomvalidity thing that I don't know-there's probably a better way.
For validating against regular expressions, see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation , and you can click the Regular expression link to get more in depth on that-->
